# Self learning for Cornell CS3110 on functional programming in OCaml

## Use containerized development environment

1. I used an automated containerized to set up OCaml environment and Visual 
   Studio Codium and publish this GitHub Repo to keep track of my learning 
   record.
2. I am new to the devcontainer so some setup may not work as expected.
3. The course itself has a [VM image](https://github.com/cs3110/vm) hosted on Cornell Box to set up the OCaml environment, but I choose to use devcontainer simply because it is more containerized and has better cross-platform support.
