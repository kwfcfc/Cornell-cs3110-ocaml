# Self learning for Cornell CS3110 on functional programming in OCaml

## Use containerized development environment

1. I used an automated containerized to set up OCaml environment and Visual 
   Studio Codium and publish this GitHub Repo to keep track of my learning 
   record.
2. I am new to the devcontainer so some setup may not work as expected.
